# 📊 Social Media Analysis Project

This project simulates and analyzes a dataset of social media posts using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It demonstrates basic data manipulation, visualization, and insight generation — ideal for showcasing skills in data analysis.

---

## 🧠 Project Summary

We generated a synthetic dataset representing social media posts with the following attributes:
- `username`: The user who made the post
- `content`: A short snippet of the post
- `likes`: Number of likes the post received
- `shares`: Number of times the post was shared
- `timestamp`: When the post was made
- `category`: Topic category of the post (e.g., tech, lifestyle, etc.)

We then performed:
- Data cleaning
- Summary statistics
- Data visualization (histograms and boxplots)
- Basic insights generation
